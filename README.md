## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are graphical representations of price movements
over a specific period. These patterns consist of a body and two shadows
(wicks) that indicate the opening and closing prices, as well as the
highest and lowest prices reached during that period.

## Types of Candlestick Patterns

-   **Bullish Patterns:** These patterns indicate a potential upward
    price movement, such as the Hammer, Bullish Engulfing, and Piercing
    Line.
-   **Bearish Patterns:** These patterns suggest a potential downward
    price movement, such as the Hanging Man, Bearish Engulfing, and Dark
    Cloud Cover.
-   **Neutral Patterns:** These patterns indicate indecision or a lack
    of clear direction, such as the Spinning Top, Doji, and Harami.

## Technical Analysis of Candlestick Patterns

Technical analysis is the study of past price movements to predict
future price trends. Candlestick patterns play a crucial role in
technical analysis, as they provide insights into market sentiment and
supply and demand dynamics.

Traders can use technical indicators such as moving averages, support
and resistance levels, and trendlines in conjunction with candlestick
patterns to identify potential trading opportunities.
